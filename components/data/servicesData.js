        Our school management system is helping the school to maintain the
        record by keeping a constant and convivial connection to the parents.
        <b> Web-school ERP</b> has the system to monitor the students and staff
        related activities. Sharing emails to the teachers and parents about
        section calendar and class-oriented information has proved to be very
        supportive of both of them. Our school management system is able to send
        the required information regarding class schedules, parent information,
        students’ health records, grades, and health records as well by SMS. It
        can also send messages about scheduled school management meetings on
        time.

        The parent section of Web-School ERP is nicely designed. Parents can
        easily access it by using their ID and password. They can track all the
        information regarding their child. The information about the other
        students is kept secret. They can monitor their child’s growth by
        keeping the track of assessment results, behavioral improvements.
        Parents can know about the schedules of extracurricular activities,
        holiday notices, class timetables, assessment rosters, and emergency
        changes. Another most helpful amenity they can get, the fees payment
        option with a valid pay-slip. Our school management software system is
        used to fulfill all the requirements of the parents to satisfy them.

        school-related information including class schedules, theory and
        practical sessions, previous chapter notes, & exam schedules. Each
        student uses this software system by logging with their individual login
        ID and password. The design of the portal is easy to operate for the
        students. By using the Smartphone they can access the software and get
